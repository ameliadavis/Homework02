            <p>
                I am a graphic designer working for Effectv (formerly Comcast spotlight) in the past year I have had the incredible opportunity to design a brand for a new internal agency (Mnemonic Agency). I was also part of the team that designed and launched the mnemonicagency.com website and now I am designing the social media strategy. I LOVE my job and am fortunate enough to work with talented amazing friends. 
                <br>
                I also believe it is important to have passions outside of the office and my hobbies inform my work. From baking incredible Gingerbread houses to floral design for family and friends I am all about trying everything at least once. Jill of all trades and master of some.
